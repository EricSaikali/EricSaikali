### Some of my coolest personal/public projects!:
Choose freely your department ;) :
- **AI & Datascience**:  a Mind/Focus controlled car, the formula of the perfect movie, a fine-tuning repo of Microsoft/phi-2, ML prediction for plasma state, and built from scratch: a Name Entity Recognition system, a Recommender system and a Information retrieval system.
- **Software Engineering**: ConnectOut an Android app buit to help people meet and hang out to learn about activities around where you live.
- **Security & Privacy**: fuzzing of libpng via Google's OSS-fuzz, a Privacy leaking SOTA attack to reconstruct images from classifiers.
